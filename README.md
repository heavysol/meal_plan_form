These files are my personal form for filling in info of each meal I pay for using my meal plan. Here's a small description of each of them as follows:
1. index.html - Structural layer of webpage; has the form
2. main.js - Client-side vanilla JS; receives the data input in index.html and dynamically writes it in meal_plan_database.txt, see below.
3. meal_plan_database.txt - Text file database that stores data from index.html; each record of data is written line-by-line by main.js
4. package.json - NodeJS file
